# Installation
 Unpack downloaded file content to a directory where StarDict looks for dictionaries (/usr/share/stardict/dic by default, or ~/.stardict/dic, or C:\Program files\stardict\dic\ on Windows, or /opt/gtk/usr/share/stardict/dic on Mac OS X).

This repo is just a backup of [cihar.com stardict dictionaries](https://cihar.com/software/slovnik/) for personal use.
